For exchanges, institutions, banks, wallets, institutional traders, large companies and financial institutions, they can contact the A0x developer team.",
      "title3": "In which blockchain is CLPD available?",
      "content3": "CLPD is available on the BASE blockchain, a layer 2 solution on Ethereum, compatible with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), built on the Optimism superstack, with the security, stability and scalability necessary to obtain transactions at the lowest cost for all payment and financial applications of CLPD.

      "content4": "When a user deposits Chilean pesos from their bank account to the stablecoin account, the equivalent CLPD are created automatically in their digital wallet. There is no other mechanism for creating CLPD.

Through this mechanism, a parity of 1:1 is maintained at all times and automatically.",

Unlike other cryptocurrencies that fluctuate in price, CLPD is designed to maintain the market relationship with the US dollar, and have an equivalent in traditional Chilean pesos respaldado 1:1 in a fully liquid Chilean national bank account. CLPD is an equivalent to the traditional Chilean peso that benefits from the speed and security of blockchain technology.",
      "title6": "How is CLPD different from a CBDC (digital currency issued by the central bank)?",
      "content6": "CLPD is issued by A0x, a private Chilean company at the intersection of blockchain and fintech. In contrast, a CBDC would be issued by the government or the central bank. While the Chilean CBDC is still in the study and exploration phase, without a determination as to whether it will be created at some point or not, CLPD is already available and will be useful for payments between people, businesses, international transfers, access to yields in DeFi, savings and investment vehicles, and other applications in a safe, fast and low-cost manner. A0x has developed this technology based on open source practices and taking into account the use of stablecoins in the world."
